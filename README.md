# HMU
Hit Me Up - Helping people grab meals with their friends.

HMU is a web app that allows users to let their friends know when they are free to grab a meal. Save the hassle of individually messaging friends or being ignored in group messages by simply posting your availability and having your friends “hit you up”.

Our app targets Columbia students. As a user, you can push live status updates and view other live status updates. It is convenient because it allows users with constantly changing schedules to be more flexible and social by setting up meals on the fly.

Our future vision is to create a stronger sense of community on the Columbia campus and provide the opportunity to connect the other great students on campus.
