* Reader: Monica
* Recorder: Jason
* Component Inspected: Posts 
* Files inspected:
	o app.py
	o userHome.html
	o showPosts.js
	o addPost.html
* General Notes
	o Could use some better documentation -- might be hard for someone unfamiliar with code to get caught up
	o Should newsfeed button just be home button?
* Problems
	o App.py
		* Not all connections with mySQL are closed at the end of each method - fixed
		* Functions not in a logical order/not that readable - fixed
	o userHome.html
		* If user does not fill out optional description field, posts on newsfeed display an empty string after “What’s up” - known issue
	o app.py
		* Lines too long (over 80 characters) - fixed
		* Meetup time and time posted were switched - fixed
	o showPosts.js
		* Nicer display of information in posts on newsfeed - for example, time posted isn’t as important, so text can be smaller - fixed
	o addPost.html
		* If there is an error submitting the form, form should pre-populate previous information in fields instead of making users retype everything
